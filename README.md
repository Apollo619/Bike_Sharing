# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the analysis
Kate has a possible **Angel** investor who might be interested in providing seed money for a bike sharing company, ***DM Bikesharing***, we want to start up in our hometown of De Moines, Iowa.

### Purpose:
Create a proposal to present to our **angel** investor. Using Tableau as the primary format for data visualization, we will create charts/graphs that tells a story of how bike sharing can be utilized in De Moines. 

## Results:
Using **Citibike** data from **New York City**, I generated key visualization charts/graphs to help demonstrate why a bike sharing company could be profitable outside of New York. 
- This first graph utilized latitude and longitude of starting trip durations to indicate the bulk of bike locations within New York City. Looking at the image below you can see that most starting locations occur within a tight vector of locations. 
  - This can be considered crucial information as De Moines is not as large of a metropolitan city as NYC but has a downtown area that could see similar compact bike locations.

- A pair of graphs to note are the **heat maps** generated based on the start and stop time for bike rentals throughout the weak and then broken down by gender (see image below). 
  - These graphs illustrate that the most common start and stop for bike sharing arise from 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm, commonly known as commuter hours, and show that users are using bike sharing for their daily commutes to and from work.
  - The ***heat map by gender*** indicates the same trend for male and female users.

- This bring us to the **User type** versus **Weekday** by **Gender** chart seen below. 
  - In this chart you can see that the greater number of users are ***”Subscribers”***, people who use the bike sharing system on a daily use. 
  - This again is important information to further illustrate the point that bike sharing is not tourist driven but used by local people who live and work in the downtown area.

- The line graph depicted below demonstrates that the lion’s share of rentals exists within a 1 to 22 minutes duration. 
  - This helps bolster the idea that subscribers are the primary users during commuter hours.

- One of the essential tasks for managing a bike sharing company will be **bike maintenance**. 
  - This can be easily tracked by *trip duration* and the *count* of how many times a bike has been rented. 
  - The bubble chart below emphasizes the usage for each bike and will allow us to, in real time, track bikes that potentially require maintenance, so we maximize opportunity.

## Summary:
**Citibike** in New York City provided Kate and I the opportunity as tourist to roam the city at our leisure and thanks to the data provided to us, we were able to generate graphs and charts that illustrated the very likely possibility of starting a bike sharing company, [DM_Bikesharing](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.meredith/viz/CitibikeAnalysis_16230869013610/NYCCitibikeAnalysis), in our home town of De Moines, Iowa. The story created using Tableau helps prove to our potential investors that bike sharing is not completely dependent on tourist rentals but by local users for daily usage.
