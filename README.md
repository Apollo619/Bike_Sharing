# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the analysis
Kate has a possible **Angel** investor who might be interested in providing seed money for a bike sharing company, ***DM Bikesharing***, we want to start up in our hometown of De Moines, Iowa.

### Purpose:
Create a proposal to present to our **angel** investor. Using Tableau as the primary format for data visualization, we will create charts/graphs that tells a story of how bike sharing can be utilized in De Moines. 

## Results:
Using **Citibike** data from **New York City**, I generated key visualization charts/graphs to help demonstrate why a bike sharing company could be profitable outside of New York. 
- This first graph utilized latitude and longitude of starting trip durations to indicate the bulk of bike locations within New York City. Looking at the image below you can see that most starting locations occur within a tight vector of locations. 
  - This can be considered crucial information as De Moines is not as large of a metropolitan city as NYC but has a downtown area that could see similar compact bike locations.

- A graph of note is the **heat map** generated based on the start and stop time for bike rentals throughout the weak (see image below). 
  - This graph illustrates that the most common start and stop for bike sharing arise from 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm, subsequently these are know as commuter hours and show that users are using bike sharing for there daily commutes to and from work.

- This bring us to the **User type** versus **Weekday** by **Gender** chart seen below. 
  - In this chart you can see that the greater number of users are ***”Subscribers”***, people who use the bike sharing system on a daily use. 
  - This again is important information to further illustrate the point that bike sharing is not tourist driven but used by local people who live and work in the downtown area.
